## Development

This project really only has a few guidelines to follow:

- Focus on the end-user's privacy and experience.
- Keep the codebase minimal and, ideally, package-free.
- Follow the [PHP Style Guide](https://gist.github.com/ryansechrest/8138375).

## Reporting Bugs

I don't use a report template, so just remember to give as much detail as 
possible about the bug you're experiencing. If there's not enough detail 
reported, emails will need to be exchanged before anyone can look into the bug.
